# Confirmation Workflow SSOT

> **SSOT Key**: `confirmation-workflow`
> **Authority**: This document defines the `pending_review` state machine used across both Stage 1 (statement import) and Stage 2 (reconciliation) of the review pipeline.
> **Cross-references**: [reconciliation.md](./reconciliation.md) §7 (Stage 1 & Stage 2 state machines), [schema.md](./schema.md), [common/extraction/readme.md](https://github.com/wangzitian0/finance_report/blob/main/common/extraction/readme.md)

## 1. Source of Truth

| Concern | Location |
|---------|----------|
| `Stage1Status` enum | `apps/backend/src/models/statement_enums.py` (enum); `apps/backend/src/models/statement_summary.py` — `StatementSummary.stage1_status` (nullable; `None` at upload, set during review workflow) |
| `Stage2Status` on match | `apps/backend/src/models/reconciliation.py` — `ReconciliationMatch.status` |
| `pending_review` usage | `apps/backend/src/routers/statements.py`, `apps/backend/src/routers/reconciliation.py` |
| Balance-chain validation | `apps/backend/src/extraction/extension/statement_validation.py` |
| Consistency checks | `apps/backend/src/services/consistency_checks.py` |

---

## 2. The `pending_review` Status

`pending_review` appears on **two distinct model fields**. They are NOT the same concept.

| Field | Model | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `StatementSummary.stage1_status = PENDING_REVIEW` | Stage 1 | Parsed statement awaiting user visual verification against the original PDF (**nullable** — `None` after upload; set to `PENDING_REVIEW` when review is triggered) |
| `ReconciliationMatch.status = PENDING_REVIEW` | Stage 2 | Reconciliation match scoring 60–84 pts, requiring human decision before journal entry creation |

Both use the string value `"pending_review"` by convention, but the state machines they live in are independent.

### Stage 1 Transitions

| From | Event | To | Guard |
|------|-------|----|-------|
| `parsed` | system auto-accept | `approved` | Score ≥ 85, balance delta ≤ 0.001 USD, confirmed active asset account in statement currency, non-overlapping source period |
| `approved` | auto-post guard failure | `pending_review` | Guard failure during high-confidence auto-post; preserve parsed statement and transactions |
| `pending_review` | `approve_statement()` | `approved` | Opening and closing balance-chain checks both pass within 0.001 USD; duplicate and transfer-pair candidates are resolved |
| `pending_review` | `reject_statement()` | `rejected` | — |
| `rejected` | re-parse triggered | `pending_review` | — |

### Stage 2 Transitions

| From | Event | To | Guard |
|------|-------|----|-------|
| `pending_review` | `accept_match()` | `accepted` | All consistency checks resolved in the active Stage 2 scope |
| `pending_review` | `reject_match()` | `rejected` | — |
| `auto_accepted` | system auto-accept | `accepted` | Score ≥ 85 |
| `accepted` | journal created | (terminal) | Accounting equation holds |

---

## 4. Design Constraints

### DO
- ✅ Always pass `user_id` to service methods that mutate `pending_review` state (ownership check)
- ✅ Validate both opening and closing balance-chain checks (0.001 USD tolerance) before advancing Stage 1
- ✅ Treat `/review/edit` as unsupported: it returns HTTP 400. To change extracted data, reject and re-parse instead of editing in place
- ✅ Block Stage 1 approve when unresolved duplicate or transfer-pair candidates remain on the statement
- ✅ Require confirmed account mapping and source-period uniqueness before Stage 1 auto-posting
- ✅ Resolve all consistency checks in the active Stage 2 scope before batch approval
- ✅ Create journal entry only on `accepted` transition (never on `pending_review`)
- ✅ Emit an audit log entry on every state transition

### DO NOT
- ❌ Combine Stage 1 status and Stage 2 status into a single field — they are independent
- ❌ Create journal entries from `pending_review` matches
- ❌ Auto-accept Stage 1 statements without opening and closing balance-chain validation
- ❌ Re-introduce in-place edit-and-approve for `/review/edit`; it is unsupported and returns HTTP 400 (reject + re-parse instead)
- ❌ Allow `pending_review → approved` bypass when duplicate/transfer checks are unresolved
- ❌ Hardcode tolerance as `0.10` in Stage 1 — Stage 1 requires `0.001 USD`

## 5. Tolerance Reference

| Context | Tolerance | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Stage 1 balance chain validation | 0.001 USD | `promotion_gate.STATEMENT_BALANCE_TOLERANCE` (#930) |
| Stage 2 reconciliation auto-accept / review | 85 / 60 | `promotion_gate.RECONCILIATION_AUTO_ACCEPT_SCORE` / `promotion_gate.RECONCILIATION_REVIEW_SCORE` (#930) |
| Stage 2 reconciliation match (amount score) | 0.10 USD | AGENTS.md, reconciliation.md |
| Reconciliation statistics comparison | 1% | AGENTS.md |

These tolerances are intentionally separate policies. Stage 1 document approval
uses the strict 0.001 USD balance-chain threshold for both the opening continuity
check and the closing transaction-sum check; extraction confidence and Stage 2
matching may use wider scoring tolerances, but they cannot approve a Stage 1
statement with either balance-chain check outside the 0.001 USD tolerance.

### <a id="confidence-tier-rollup"></a>Confidence Tier Rollup (resolves OD4)

Confidence tiers rank by trust: `TRUSTED > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW`. A line or
aggregate takes the **worst-input tier** — it is only as trustworthy as its
least-trusted contributing fact. This is a defined rollup (a `min`), never an
invented blended score.

- A report line's tier is the worst tier among the journal entries contributing
  to it (tier derived from `source_type` via `confidence_tier`).
- An aggregate (e.g. Net Worth) takes the worst tier across its rated lines.
  Lines with no derivable tier (e.g. market-derived adjustments) are excluded
  from the rollup rather than counted as trusted; the aggregate is `null` when
  nothing is rated.
- Manual valuations are user-supplied, explicitly trusted data and surface as
  `TRUSTED`.

Owned first by the balance sheet (EPIC-005 AC5.18, issue #913). A `% trusted`
proportion is a separate, additive signal (the North-Star metric, EPIC-018
AC18.12), not the per-node badge.

### Promotion Gate (makes confidence load-bearing)

The single deterministic contract that decides whether a versioned fact (see
[schema.md → Append-Only Fact Versioning](schema.md)) may become authoritative.
Owned by `services/promotion_gate.py` (EPIC-018 AC18.13, issue #930):

> **authoritative ⇔ invariants_pass ∧ confidence ≥ τ**

- **Invariants first.** A single failed deterministic invariant (e.g. the
  balance-chain check outside `STATEMENT_BALANCE_TOLERANCE`) → `rejected`,
  regardless of confidence. Strong code is never overridden by a high score.
- **Then confidence.** All invariants pass but confidence below the named
  threshold → `review` (a non-authoritative candidate, escalated for a human).
- **Both pass** → `authoritative`.
- The verdict records the failing invariant and its `delta` vs `tolerance`, so the
  escalation reason is queryable — not a bare status string.

The thresholds in the table above are named constants owned here, not magic
numbers buried in services. AI / Derived versions may only *propose*; the gate
disposes. Wiring each decision site to call the gate (vs. consuming the shared
constants) is incremental; the runtime that *generates* Derived versions or
dispatches escalations is a separate EPIC.

### Correction Feedback Loop (drives the proportion down)

The North-Star metric (EPIC-018 AC18.12) measures the low-confidence proportion;
this is the mechanism that *moves* it. Owned by `services/correction_loop.py`
(EPIC-018 AC18.14, issue #931):

- Every human correction that overrode an AI proposal is labeled signal, recorded
  append-only in `CorrectionLog`.
- The **corpus** is a projection of that store keyed by the transaction pattern —
  not a sidecar decision table that would drift from the provenance graph.
- A deterministic **held-out replay** builds priors from a train split and grounds
  recurring held-out patterns, so the low-confidence proportion strictly drops
  exactly when corrections recur (and never invents a gain when they do not).

Live grounding of generation, threshold calibration of the promotion gate from the
corpus, and the dispatch runtime are follow-ups.

## 6. API Contract

### Stage 1 Endpoints (in `routers/statements.py`)

| Endpoint | Input | Side Effect |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `POST /api/statements/{id}/review/approve` | `statement_id`, bearer token | stage1_status → approved; opening and closing balance-chain validation enforced (≤ 0.001 USD); unresolved duplicate/transfer-pair candidates rejected; queues to Stage 2 |
| `POST /api/statements/{id}/review/reject` | `statement_id`, `reason`, bearer token | stage1_status → rejected; triggers re-parse |
| `POST /api/statements/{id}/review/edit` | `statement_id`, edits, bearer token | Unsupported — returns HTTP 400. In-place edit-and-approve is removed; reject and re-parse to change extracted data |
| `GET /api/statements/pending-review` | bearer token | Returns `[StatementSummary]` where `status=PARSED` and either `stage1_status=PENDING_REVIEW` or `stage1_status` is null for legacy parsed rows |
### Stage 2 Endpoints (reconciliation + statements routers)

| Endpoint | Input | Side Effect |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `POST /api/reconciliation/matches/{id}/accept` | `match_id`, bearer token | status → accepted; creates journal entry |
| `POST /api/reconciliation/matches/{id}/reject` | `match_id`, bearer token | status → rejected |
| `POST /api/reconciliation/batch-accept` | `[match_id]`, bearer token | Accepts all provided matches; blocked if any related consistency check is unresolved; creates journal entries |
| `GET /api/statements/stage2/queue` | optional `run_id`, bearer token | Returns pending matches and the full unresolved consistency-check set for the user or requested run scope |
| `POST /api/statements/batch-approve-matches` | `[match_id]`, optional `run_id`, bearer token | Stage 2 batch acceptance scoped to the requested run when provided; routes each pending match through `accept_match()`, creates missing journal entries or reconciles referenced entries, and returns accepted/created/reconciled counts |
| `GET /api/reconciliation/pending` | bearer token | Returns `[ReconciliationMatch]` with `status=pending_review` |

| `test_ac16_22_7_tolerance_policy_constants_are_intentional` | `review/test_tolerance_policy.py` | Stage 1 and extraction/reconciliation tolerances remain intentionally separate |
| `test_approve_statement_invalid_balance_fails` | `review/test_statement_validation.py` | Approve blocked if balance bad |
| `test_AC16_32_1_stage1_approval_blocks_unresolved_conflicts` | `api/test_statements_router.py` | Stage 1 approve blocked if duplicate/transfer candidates remain |
| `test_AC16_32_3_stage2_queue_returns_all_pending_checks` | `api/test_statements_router.py` | Stage 2 queue returns the complete unresolved blocker set |
| `test_AC19_11_1_stage2_run_queue_filters_by_run_id` | `api/test_statements_router.py` | Run-scoped Stage 2 queue and approval cannot affect another run |
| `test_batch_approve_requires_checks_resolved` | `review/test_review_workflow.py` | Stage 2 batch blocked by open checks (⏳ Planned) |
| `test_journal_entry_created_on_accept` | `review/test_review_workflow.py` | Journal entry only on accepted transition (⏳ Planned) |
| `test_batch_approve_matches_reconciles_referenced_entry` | `api/test_statements_router.py` | Stage 2 batch approval reconciles referenced journal entries |
| `test_batch_approve_matches_creates_missing_entry_once` | `api/test_statements_router.py` | Stage 2 batch approval creates missing journal entries idempotently |
| `test_stage1_approve_promotes_source_type` | `extraction/test_source_type_promotion.py` | Stage 1 approve raises source_type to user_confirmed (✅ Implemented) |
