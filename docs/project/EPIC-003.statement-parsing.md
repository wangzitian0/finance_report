## 👥 Multi-Role Review

| Role | Focus | Review Opinion |
|------|--------|----------|
| 🏗️ **Architect** | Decoupled Design | AI only handles parsing, does not write directly to ledger, errors filtered through validation layer |
| 💻 **Developer** | API Integration | Gemini 2.0 Flash (free) single-model parsing; user retry selects a different model |
| 📊 **Accountant** | Data Integrity | Opening + Transactions ≈ Closing, reject if validation fails |
| 🔗 **Reconciler** | Downstream Dependencies | Parsing results must be structured for matching algorithms |
| 🧪 **Tester** | Parsing Accuracy | Multi-bank, multi-format coverage testing, target ≥ 95% |
| 📋 **PM** | User Experience | Drag-and-drop upload, parsing progress, user-friendly error messages |

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Unit tests (Required)

```python
# Balance validation
def test_balance_validation_passes():
    """Opening 1000 + Transactions 500 - 300 = Closing 1200"""

def test_balance_validation_fails():
    """Opening 1000 + Transactions 500 ≠ Closing 1600"""

# Parsing results
def test_parse_dbs_pdf():
    """DBS statement parsing with complete fields"""

def test_parse_invalid_pdf():
    """Non-statement PDF should return parsing failure"""
```

### Integration tests (Required)

```python
def test_upload_and_parse_flow():
    """Complete upload→parse→validate→persist flow"""

def test_duplicate_upload_detection():
    """Duplicate file upload should trigger warning"""

## 📝 Technical Debt

| Item | Priority | Planned Resolution |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Local PDF parsing fallback | P2 | Future iteration |
| Additional bank support (UOB, Citi) | P3 | Future iteration |
| OCR preprocessing (scanned docs) | P3 | Future iteration |

## 🛡️ Post-Release Fixes

| Fix | PR | Root Cause |
|-----|-----|------------|
| `account_last4` sanitization — strip non-alphanumeric, take last 4 chars | #269 | AI returned `553-3` (5 chars with hyphen), exceeding VARCHAR(4) → `StringDataRightTruncationError` |
| `_handle_parse_failure` rollback-first — rollback before re-fetching statement | #269 | Secondary `PendingRollbackError` crashed error handler, leaving statement stuck in `PARSING` forever |
| Frontend parsing timeout + rejected alert — 5-min timeout, retry only when stuck | #269 | No UI feedback when parsing got stuck; user had no way to recover |

## Issues & Gaps

- [x] Align BankStatement and BankStatementTransaction fields with SSOT extraction (file_hash, confidence_score, balance_validated, etc.).
- [x] Align model/config with SSOT (Gemini 2.0 Flash (free) with manual model selection).
- [x] Add confidence scoring and review queue routing (`/api/statements/pending-review`) to tasks and acceptance criteria.
- [x] Standardize institution/template scope across checklist, Q5 decision, and SSOT supported institutions.
- [x] Enforce balance validation routing (invalid balances route to manual entry and capture validation_error).

## ❓ Q&A (Clarification Required)

### Q5: Bank Priority Support
> **Question**: Which bank statements should be supported in the first version?

**✅ Your Answer**: DBS + China Merchants Bank + Maybank + Wise, also need support for brokerages, insurance and various institutions. Adopt generic structure + flexible extension field design.

**Decision**: Adopt highly extensible statement model
- **Core fields** (unified for all statements):
  - `period_start`, `period_end`, `opening_balance`, `closing_balance`
  - `transactions[]` with standardized fields: `txn_date`, `amount`, `direction`, `description`
- **Extension fields** (JSONB):
  - `bank_specific_data`: Bank-specific fields (e.g., reference number, transaction code)
  - `institution_type`: Institution type marker (bank, brokerage, insurance, wallet, etc.)
  - `custom_fields`: User-defined custom fields
- **Prompt templates** grouped by institution type:
  - `templates/dbs.yaml`
  - `templates/cmb.yaml`
  - `templates/maybank.yaml`
  - `templates/fintech_generic.yaml` (Wise, Revolut, etc.)
  - `templates/brokerage_generic.yaml`
  - `templates/insurance_generic.yaml`
- **Institution library maintenance**:
  - Frontend provides institution/account type selector
  - Users can configure prompt templates for new institutions
  - Community-contributed template library

### Q6: Gemini API Cost Control
> **Question**: How to control Gemini API call costs?

**✅ Your Answer**: Use OpenRouter, $2 daily limit is enforced at API level, no additional application-layer limits needed

**Decision**: Application layer relies on OpenRouter official limits
- Call Gemini 2.0 Flash (free) through OpenRouter (not direct Google API)
- OpenRouter has daily quota management, automatically returns 429 error when exceeded
- Application layer does not need to implement call limits, but must gracefully handle API quota exhaustion
- When OpenRouter returns quota exhaustion, notify the user and require a manual retry
- Environment variables: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_DAILY_LIMIT_USD=2`

### Q7: Parsing Failure Handling
> **Question**: What can users do when parsing fails?

**✅ Your Answer**: C - Support retry + manual editing. Prioritize upgrading to stronger model on retry.

**Decision**: Manual retry with explicit model selection
- Use a single model for parsing by default
- On failure, user retries with a selected model from the catalog
- UI displays retry progress and the selected model

### Q8: Statement-Account Linking
> **Question**: How to link statement to specific account on upload?

**✅ Your Answer**: C - Parse first then confirm, AI recommends account linking, user confirms

**Decision**: Two-step flow - Parse + Confirm linking
- User can optionally select account on upload, or leave blank for AI recommendation
- After parsing, extract account information from statement (bank name, last 4 digits of account, currency, etc.)
- Based on extracted info, find matching Account in system
  - Exact match: Last 4 digits + currency completely match
  - Fuzzy match: Bank name + currency match
- Frontend confirmation page displays:
  - Extracted account information (bank, account suffix, account holder, etc.)
  - System-recommended account (with confidence score)
  - User can select recommended account or manually choose
  - "Create New Account" entry point (if recommended account doesn't exist)

### Q9: Historical Statement Import
> **Question**: Do we need to support batch import of historical statements?

**✅ Your Answer**: C - Support batch upload + async queue processing. Each upload corresponds to an independent ETL task.

**Decision**: Async ETL task queue architecture
- **Upload phase**:
  - Support multi-file drag-and-drop (or zip) upload
  - Each file immediately creates a `StatementProcessingTask` record
  - Return task ID list and task queue link to user
- **Task structure**:
  ```python
  class StatementProcessingTask:
      id: UUID
      file_name: str
      file_size: int
      upload_at: datetime
      status: Enum  # pending/processing/completed/failed
      progress: int  # 0-100 percentage
      error_message: Optional[str]
      extracted_data: Optional[dict]
      account_id: Optional[UUID]
  ```
- **Processing flow** (independent tasks):
  1. Upload file to temporary storage
  2. Async worker process pulls task (status=pending)
  3. Call Gemini for parsing (record progress)
  4. Validate balance (opening+transactions≈closing)
  5. Store BankStatementTransaction
  6. Update task status to completed/failed
- **Queue implementation**:
  - Use Redis queue or Celery (depending on deployment environment)
  - Support task priority (single file has highest priority)
- Task retry strategy (manual retry only)
- **UI**:
  - Redirect to "Task Queue" page after upload
  - Display progress bar, status, error messages for each task
  - Support canceling pending tasks
  - Auto-refresh statement list when completed
