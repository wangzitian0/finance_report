# AI Financial Advisor

The AI Financial Advisor helps you interpret reports, spot trends, and answer finance-related questions based on your posted data. It is strictly read-only and cannot create, edit, or delete ledger entries.

## Where to Access

- **Chat page**: `/chat`
- **Floating widget**: Available on dashboard and report pages
- **Report shortcuts**: "AI Interpretation" buttons on balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow pages
- **Unmatched transactions**: "Ask AI" in the unmatched triage view

## What It Can Do

- Summarize balance sheet and income statement insights
- Explain expense trends and category changes
- Describe reconciliation health and unmatched counts
- Provide high-level budgeting recommendations

## What It Will Refuse

- Creating, posting, or editing journal entries
- Deleting data or bypassing system rules
- Sharing sensitive information such as account numbers or passwords
- Non-financial questions

## Data Scope

The advisor only uses summarized data from posted or reconciled records. It does not receive raw statements, full account numbers, or credentials.

## Tips for Better Answers

- Ask about a time period ("this month", "last quarter")
- Reference a report ("income statement from Jan to Mar")
- Mention a category ("dining" or "transportation")

## Disclaimer

Every response ends with a disclaimer. The AI provides guidance only and does not replace professional advice.
