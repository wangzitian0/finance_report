# `runtime` — the app↔external-world dependency boundary

## Why this package exists

The application depends on external backends — object storage (S3), the LLM
provider, cache (Redis), telemetry (OTel), analytics (OpenPanel), the database.
Today that boundary is **homeless**: `ServiceStatus` + `_check_*` float in
`apps/backend/src/boot.py`, env keys live in `config`, the smoke test is a shell
script, and the six-environment tiering lives in `environments.md`. Nobody owns
the *contract* across them — which is exactly why dependencies **degrade
silently** (`_check_ai_provider` returns `"skipped"` when unconfigured; S3 is
treated as "optional" and only `warning`s when down).

`runtime` is the bounded context that owns that boundary: **what we depend on,
how each environment provides or substitutes it, and the guarantee that a
declared dependency is proven present — or the build/smoke fails.**

## Ubiquitous language

- **Dependency** — an external backend the app talks to across a process edge.
- **Kind** — how a dependency must be tested:
  - **code-dominant** (e.g. S3, Redis): deterministic; a light substitute behaves
    identically to the real backend, so it is behaviourally equivalent everywhere.
  - **model-dominant** (e.g. the LLM): non-deterministic; output depends on the
    real service. *Input changes ⇒ result changes* — so CI uses an **input-keyed
    recording**, and the real behaviour is validated only against staging.
- **Substitute** — the per-environment stand-in for a dependency. A *backend* may
  differ per environment (in-memory ≠ minio ≠ real S3); that is expected and fine.
- **Env tier** — one of the six environments (Local Dev / Local CI / GitHub CI /
  PR Preview / Staging / Production). CI and Preview use **light substitutes**
  (Preview = same as CI but persistent); Staging and Production use **real**
  backends.
- **Declared vs present** — each env *declares* its required dependencies (via env
  vars, owned with `config`); a dependency is either **present** or **absent** —
  there is no `skipped`.

## Invariants (the contract)

1. **Declared ⇒ asserted.** Every dependency an environment declares as required
   has a check, a substitute, and a smoke assertion.
2. **Absent ⇒ fail.** A declared dependency that is missing/unreachable fails
   `/health` and the smoke test. No silent `skipped` / `warning` / fallback.
3. **Substitute by tier.** CI/Preview run light substitutes; Staging/Production
   run real backends. The *backend* may differ per env; the *presence* must not.
4. **code-dominant ⇒ real adapter runs in CI.** The substitute fakes the
   *backend* (in-memory), never the app's own adapter — so the real adapter code
   executes in CI (no wrapper-stub like `DummyStorage`).
5. **model-dominant ⇒ recorded in CI, real on staging.** CI replays an
   input-keyed recording (changed input ⇒ recording miss); the real provider is
   exercised only by the staging gate (which does **not** read recordings).
6. **Smoke ↔ declaration parity.** The smoke test asserts exactly the declared set
   for its tier (count == declared count); a release tag promotes only after the
   **staging** smoke (real backends, real LLM) passes.

## Shape (port / adapter, per the `base`/`extension`/`data` model)

- **base** — the `DependencyCheck` port (the `ServiceStatus`/check protocol) + the
  **DependencyManifest** (declared required dependencies per env tier) + the value
  language (`Kind`, `EnvTier`, presence status — no `skipped`).
- **extension** — the per-dependency check/substitute adapters (db, s3, llm,
  redis, telemetry). Each implements the port; an adapter may instead live in its
  own domain package and implement this port (dependency inversion).
- **api** — `boot.validate` and the **environment smoke test**
  (`docs/ssot/env_smoke_test.md`, `tools/smoke_test.sh`) are this package's
  boundary: `runtime` **owns** the smoke test — the deployed-environment
  verification that every declared dependency is present (invariants 2 and 6),
  plus the version-integrity / routing / functional checks it composes.

## Boundaries with neighbouring packages

- **`config`** — owns the env-var *mechanism*: the three-layer SSOT
  (`secrets.ctmpl` ↔ `config.py` ↔ `.env.example`), the pydantic `Settings`
  reader, and schema validation — shared by every package. `runtime` owns the
  *dependency layer* on top: the **manifest is the SSOT for which env vars are
  external-dependency env vars** (`Dependency.env_vars`, bound to `Settings`),
  each dependency's kind, its per-tier substitute, and the presence assertion.
  (Only dependency env vars consolidate here — feature/security/domain env vars
  stay with `config` and their domain packages.)
- **`testing`** — owns proof *provenance* (`deterministic` / `golden_fixture` /
  `live_llm`); `runtime`'s `Kind` maps onto it (code-dominant → deterministic,
  model-dominant → live on staging).
- **`platform`** — the *in-process* middleware substrate (event bus, rate limiter).
  `runtime` is the complementary *outbound* substrate (the edges to the external
  world). Distinct concerns; sibling kernels.
- **`observability`** — telemetry is itself a dependency `runtime` declares/asserts,
  but its own emit/query logic stays in `observability`.

## Public vs internal

Draft. The **construct** phase publishes the `base` value language + manifest +
port (`contract.interface`): `DependencyKind`, `EnvTier` (+ `APP_OWNED_TIERS` /
`VPS_TIERS`), `Dependency` / `DependencyManifest` / `DEPENDENCY_MANIFEST`, and the
`DependencyCheck` port (+ `DependencyStatus`). No consumer routes through it yet —
the switch phase points `boot.validate` and the smoke test at the manifest; the
adapters and the compose/lifecycle relocation follow. See [`todo.md`](./todo.md).
