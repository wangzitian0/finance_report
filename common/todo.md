# `common/` — cross-package / migration worklist

The horizontal worklist for migrating to the target architecture in
[`meta/migration-standard.md`](./meta/migration-standard.md). Each package also
keeps its own `common/<pkg>/todo.md`; this file tracks the migration *between*
packages and the phase order. Umbrella issue: **#1416**.

## Target: 10 packages

Two governors + middleware + the financial flow (see the standard for each
package's base/extension/data + entities + governance domain):

- **meta** — governs *form* (structure/deps/acyclic/progress).
- **audit** — governs *number* (= the old `value` folded in: financial base types
  + accounting consistency + traceability).
- **middleware** — event bus / outbox / workflow / pipeline / counter / identity.
- **llm** — provider abstraction / cassette / stream.
- financial flow: `(extraction [auto] + portfolio [manual]) → reconciliation → ledger → reporting → advisor`.

Internal layering is **base↓ / extension↑ / data** (replaces kernel/platform/core
and types/ops/store/api). ACs are `AC-<pkg>.<entity>.<seq>` in each contract's
`roadmap`. **The migration unit is the AC.**

## Phases (each package cutover = one atomic PR, by the standard's DoD)

| phase | scope | issue · status |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 0a | standard doc + `governance→meta` rename | #1414 ✅ |
| 0b | `counter` → base/extension/data template + gate three-layer rule (additive) | #1418 ⬜ |
| 1 | `value → audit` fold | #1419 ⬜ |
| 2 | `ledger` | #1420 ⬜ |
| 3 | `extraction` #1421 · `portfolio` #1422 · `reconciliation` #1423 · `reporting` #1424 | ⬜ |
| 4 | `advisor` #1425 · `llm` #1426 · `middleware` #1427 · `identity` #1428 | ⬜ |
| 5 | `audit` consistency closeout (global invariants + cross-package ACs) | #1429 ⬜ |
| 6 | cleanup — delete residual EPIC tables / SSOT; retire central MANIFEST/registry gates once meta's data layer is the computed index | #1430 ⬜ |

All tracked under umbrella **#1416**.

## Definition of Done per package (from the standard)

A package cutover is one atomic PR that:
1. moves each AC to the package `roadmap` as `AC-<pkg>.<entity>.<seq>` (removed from the EPIC table);
2. deletes the EPIC only once **all** its ACs are distributed;
3. internalizes the package's owned SSOT (into readme/contract; removed from `docs/ssot/` + `MANIFEST.yaml`);
4. migrates its tests (every `invariants[].test` / `roadmap[].test` resolves);
5. repoints consumers to the published `interface` (`__all__`), not submodules;
6. is green (`check_package_contract` + the package's own invariants).

Different packages may be old-or-new during the migration; a single package is
never left half in both an EPIC and a roadmap.

## Conventions every migration must keep

- A package's ACs live in its `contract.py` `roadmap`, **never** mirrored into an
  EPIC table.
- `contract.interface` must equal the BE implementation's `__init__.__all__`;
  FE conforms to the same interface + conformance vectors (FE picks its own impl).
- `base` imports only `base` (downward DAG); `extension` is a separate import
  surface (no cycle); `data` is metadata only. Rule: *never up, never sideways-cyclic*.
- Adding a package adds no central index edit — shipping `common/<pkg>/contract.py`
  registers it with the governance gate.
