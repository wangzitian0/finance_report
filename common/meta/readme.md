## What a package is

A **package = a DDD bounded context**. It is the unit of ownership and
governance. Its authoritative form lives in `common/<pkg>/`; the running code is
a conforming *implementation* the contract points at. Every package is exactly
these parts:

1. **`readme.md`** (`common/<pkg>/readme.md`) — prose: the *ubiquitous language*,
   why the package exists, a usage example, and what is public vs internal. (The
   review surface.)
2. **`contract.py`** (`common/<pkg>/contract.py`) — a machine-checkable
   `PackageContract` (a pydantic model): the package's `status`, `klass`
   (its layer, resolved from the central `PACKAGE_LAYER` map — not self-claimed),
   `units` (its DDD building blocks, each carrying its `kind` → layer; `roles` is
   the legacy form), `implementations`, published `interface`, emitted `events`,
   the `invariants` it guarantees, and its `roadmap` (the ACs it owns).
3. **`todo.md`** (`common/<pkg>/todo.md`) — the package's own worklist.
4. **Implementations** — the conforming code under `apps/backend/src/<pkg>`
   (`implementations["be"]`) and/or `apps/frontend/src/lib/<pkg>`
   (`implementations["fe"]`). Files converge by **role**, not by feature:
   - `types/` — domain **nouns** + events (the value language; pure, no I/O).
   - `ops/` — domain **verbs** (the edges in the project DAG; depend on a store
     *port*, never a concrete store or the ORM).
   - `store/` — persistence: a `Protocol` **port** + a concrete adapter (the only
     role that touches the ORM/session).
   - `api/` — the boundary (in-process verbs, or a thin transport adapter).
5. **Published language** — the implementation's `__init__.__all__` is the
   *entire* public surface; everything else is internal. `contract.interface`
   must equal that `__all__`.

The role folders above are the legacy convergence. The forward model converges by
the **DDD building block → layer** table (`base` / `extension` / `data`): each
`unit`'s `kind` decides its layer (`KIND_LAYER`), a repository splits into a base
port + an extension adapter, and `data` is the read-model sink. See
[`migration-standard.md`](./migration-standard.md#internal-layering-replaces-kernelplatformcore-and-typesopsstoreapi)
for the full table and the three cycle-breaking mechanisms; `meta` itself is the
live exemplar.

So `common/<pkg>/` is the **spec + high-level review surface**;
`apps/backend/src/<pkg>` and `apps/frontend/src/lib/<pkg>` are conforming
**implementations**.

## The five-layer topology

Every package sits in one of five ordered layers — `meta < infra < middleware <
domain < app`. Placement is **global topology**, so it is owned here in L0 as
the central `PACKAGE_LAYER` map ([`base/layering.py`](./base/layering.py)): a
package's `contract.py` does not self-claim a `klass`; the model resolves it
from the map (a declared value must agree with the map; only packages outside
the map — synthetic/test contracts — declare one).

The dependency rule is **never up, never sideways-cyclic**: a package may never
import a *higher* layer, and may import a *same-layer* package only when it
declares it in `depends_on` **and** the overall graph stays acyclic. (Enforced
by `check_package_contract`: the upward guard + a global cycle check.) So a
cohesive family — the value types — can share one layer and depend on each
other acyclically.

    meta -.->|"tool-time inversion: CI gates scan every<br/>contract.py — never a runtime import"| L4
```

Two edge *phases* keep the picture acyclic:

- the **template edge** is import-time and points down: every `contract.py`
  imports `PackageContract` from L0;
- the **governance edge** is tool-time and points up: `meta`'s `extension/`
  gates scan every package's contract in CI, outside the runtime import DAG.
  Wherever a lower layer must know about a higher one, the edge is inverted
  through exactly two legal forms — a port in the lower layer's `base` with the
  adapter registered from above (import-time), or a declaration in the upper
  package's contract scanned by the lower package's `extension` at tool-time.

| layer | what it is | examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `meta` (L0) | the template every package follows + the global governance gates; governs only at package granularity (`contract.py`), never implementations | `meta` |
| `infra` (L1) | business-agnostic foundations — L1 does not know what money is | `config`, `audit`, `authority`, `observability`, `testing`, `coverage`, `runtime`, `llm`, `platform` |
| `middleware` (L2) | the shared domain kernel: the value language + generic capabilities | `money`, `ratio`, `quantity`, `unit_price`, `counter` |
| `domain` (L3) | vertical business slices | `ledger`, `identity`, `extraction` |
| `app` (L4) | the deliverables | `apps/backend`, `apps/frontend` |

## Governance is computed, not authored

The only **authored horizontal doc is `vision.md`** (the "why"). Everything else
about a package is *derived from its contract*:

- `tools/check_package_contract.py` (logic in
  [`extension/check_package_contract.py`](./extension/check_package_contract.py))
  discovers every package by scanning `common/*/contract.py` for a
  `CONTRACT = PackageContract(...)` and asserts, per package:
  - **(a)** `contract.interface == __init__.__all__` of the BE implementation
    (`implementations["be"]`) — contract and published language agree;
  - **(b)** every `invariants[].test` and `roadmap[].test` (a `"path::func"`
    reference) resolves to a real test function (an unproven invariant is not an
    invariant);
  - **(c)** no implementation module imports a **higher-class** registered
    package or an undeclared dependency (the DAG rule, mirroring
    `tests/tooling/test_ledger_module.py`);
  - **(d)** for a package that adopts the `base/extension/` split: `base` stays
    pure (A), each declared `unit` sits in its `kind`'s layer + a repository splits
    port/adapter (B), and `data` is a sink nothing imports — additive, so legacy
    role-folder packages keep passing.
- The AC registry sources a package's ACs **directly from its `roadmap`**:
  `common/meta/extension/generate_ac_registry.py` reads `common/*/contract.py` roadmaps
  additively (alongside the EPIC tables), so a package's ACs live in its contract
  and are **never mirrored** into an EPIC table.
- The vision proof matrix sources direct package backing from each roadmap AC's
  optional `vision_anchor` via the pure `ac_vision_index` projection. EPIC docs
  still declare which historical goal owns an anchor; no central AC-to-vision
  mapping is hand-maintained.

Because governance reads the contract, adding a package adds no central index to
edit: a new package is governed when `common/<pkg>/contract.py` exports a
module-level `CONTRACT = PackageContract(...)`.

### Dependency impact is a generated review plane

`PackageContract.depends_on` and `PackageContract.interface` remain the authored
facts. `common/meta/base/dependency_graph.py` validates those facts as one typed
acyclic graph and computes direct plus transitive consumers; the pure
`dependency_index` projection exposes that graph without filesystem I/O. There
is no authored dependency table alongside the contracts.

`common/meta/extension/dependency_report.py` owns the impure review edge. It
reads only the dependency-relevant contract literals and public definitions via
AST, archives the chosen Git base ref into an isolated temporary tree, and
builds that historical snapshot in a clean `python -I` subprocess before
comparing it with the working tree. A historical contract is therefore never
reinterpreted through HEAD's `PackageContract` model. The JSON report includes
added/removed typed edges, changed public signatures, and the union of base/head
direct and transitive consumers. Public-boundary inspection starts at each
implementation root and follows eager, chained, wildcard, and the repository's
bounded lazy `__getattr__` export forms plus local assignment aliases to the
owning definition. Its signature retains that binding path plus overload
declarations, annotated values,
decorators, generic type parameters, local and repository-imported named defaults,
annotation aliases (including `TYPE_CHECKING` declarations), class construction,
repository-owned inherited APIs, public protocol dunder methods, and other public
class members. Bare and module-qualified project bindings use the same resolver.
Value bindings are fingerprinted at their assignment/import time, so later
rebinding cannot rewrite a captured default or alias. Wildcard binding obeys the
target's `__all__`; missing
explicit or lazy targets and ambiguous lazy control flow fail closed. Every declared public
symbol gets exactly one snapshot record, and the repository snapshot is ratcheted
to zero unresolved dynamic exports; a declaration with no statically visible
binding is exposed as `dynamic-export` rather than silently matched to an
unrelated same-named definition. Unreadable refs, empty discovery,
duplicate/unknown/self edges, and cycles fail closed.

The report is ephemeral CI output, not SSOT: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` appends
its Markdown view to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, while the contracts remain the only
authored dependency source. Run the same report locally with:

```bash
apps/backend/.venv/bin/python tools/report_ddd_dependencies.py \
  --base-ref origin/main \
  --json-out /tmp/ddd-dependencies.json \
  --markdown-out /tmp/ddd-dependencies.md
```

This first plane represents `depends_on` as `compile` edges. Typed ports, event
subscriptions, delivery/composition bindings, and the frontend L4 graph extend
the same vocabulary in later #1894 slices; they do not create parallel graphs.

That additive discovery has a blind spot: a directory with no discoverable
`CONTRACT = PackageContract(...)` export is invisible to
`check_package_contract`, not rejected — exactly how `common/ci`,
`common/shell`, and `common/ssot` accumulated as undeclared junk drawers before
being dissolved back into real packages (#1564-#1568, #1430).
`tools/check_package_directory_coverage.py` (logic in
[`extension/check_package_directory_coverage.py`](./extension/check_package_directory_coverage.py))
closes that gap from the other direction: every directory directly under
`common/` must ship a `contract.py` with a module-level
`CONTRACT = PackageContract(...)` **or** be a documented, reasoned entry in
`UNGOVERNED_EXCEPTIONS` (now empty after the migration cleanup) — so a
lowercase, wrong-type, or unloadable pseudo-contract fails the gate instead of
silently bypassing package governance.

## Examples

- **`meta`** (`platform`, the meta-package) — self-hosts the model **and** is the
  live example of a project-level shared (meta-model) package — the building-block
  layering it governs, applied to itself. Its
  [`contract.py`](./contract.py) publishes `PackageContract` / `ACRecord` /
  `Invariant` / `Kind` / `Unit` / `DependencyKind` / `DependencyEdge` /
  `contract_index` / `dependency_index` / `ac_vision_index`, declares its `units` (the
  `PackageContract` aggregate + value objects in `base/`, the gate as a
  `domain-service` in `extension/`, both indexes as projections in
  `data/`), and its invariants + `AC-meta.*` roadmap pin to the governance-gate
  tests, so the model proves itself.
- **`counter`** (`platform`) — the first full worked example: per-(user, key)
  tallies for insight reports. `CounterKey`/`Count` value objects (`types`),
  `increment`/`get_count` verbs (`ops`) over a `CounterRepository` port (`store`),
  a thin async `read_count` boundary (`api`), and a `PackageContract` whose
  `roadmap` owns `AC-counter.1.1`–`AC-counter.1.4`. See its
  [`readme.md`](../counter/readme.md) and
  [`contract.py`](../counter/contract.py).
- **`ledger`** (`core`) — the double-entry bounded context; the first `core`
  domain cut over to the building-block layering (`base`/`extension`/`data` with
  the balance invariant as a type, the journal `Repository` split as a base port +
  extension adapter, and the account-balance projection as a `data` sink). See its
  [`readme.md`](../ledger/readme.md) and [`contract.py`](../ledger/contract.py).

## Migrating a module into the package model

The recipe for moving a module (and its EPIC-table ACs) into the package model.
**`counter` is the canonical worked example — copy its
[`contract.py`](../counter/contract.py).** One PR per package; `base=main`.

1. **Name the bounded context and its axes.** Pick the package `name` (its
   `common/<name>/` dir), its **layer** — add the package to `PACKAGE_LAYER` in
   [`base/layering.py`](./base/layering.py) (`meta < infra < middleware <
   domain < app`; placement is L0-owned global topology, so the contract does
   not self-claim a klass) — and the authority **tier**
   ([`base/authority_matrix.py`](./base/authority_matrix.py): CODE-ONLY/CODE-LED/LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY — how
   the module is built; the tier model is module-level on `PackageContract`,
   not a standalone package). If the tier is genuinely undecided, ship `status="draft"`
   with `tier=None` and resolve it before going `active` (the shipped-package
   rule). **One package = one tier**; a module mixing deterministic + LLM-emitted
   behavior is two packages.

2. **Write `contract.py`.** One `PackageContract(...)` with `name`,
   `status`, `tier`, `depends_on` (down-only edges), `units` (the DDD building
   blocks, each `Unit(kind=…, module=…)`; `roles` is the legacy form) — no
   `klass`: the model resolves it from `PACKAGE_LAYER` —
   `implementations` (`be`/`fe` paths), `interface` (must equal the BE
   `__init__.__all__`), `events`, `invariants`, `roadmap`.

3. **Domain ACs → `roadmap`.** Each `ACRecord(id, statement, test, priority,
   status)` with a **package-scoped id `AC-{package}.{group}.{seq}`** (e.g.
   `AC-counter.1.1`). The AC inherits the package tier; `proof_kind` defaults to
   the tier's canonical kind — set it explicitly only when different, and it MUST
   satisfy the tier→proof matrix (LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY may never be `exact`). When
   an AC directly backs product direction, set its optional `vision_anchor` to
   an actual lowercase anchor id from `vision.md`; `ac_vision_index` computes
   the AC-to-anchor projection, and the vision proof gate rejects unknown ids.

4. **Structural guarantees → `invariants`, NOT `roadmap`.** interface==`__all__`,
   converges-by-layer (base/extension/data), layer purity, "passes its own gate"
   carry no tier and are not matrix-constrained. (Keeping them out of `roadmap` is what lets an LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY
   package's structural `exact` tests stay valid — see counter's 7 invariants.)

5. **Anchor every `test` to a real test.** Each `roadmap[].test` /
   `invariants[].test` is a `"path::func"` the gate resolves. Put
   `@ac_proof(ac_ids=["AC-<pkg>.x.y"])` on the **domain-AC** tests only;
   **structural/invariant tests do NOT carry `@ac_proof`** — they are governed
   via `invariants[].test`, not the AC critical-proof matrix (a structural test
   tagged with a domain AC id is a stale anchor — see counter's cleanup).

6. **Renumber the migrated AC to the package-scoped `AC-<pkg>.x.y`** — that id
   form is the target (the package owns its ACs). Renumbering is a cross-repo
   rename, so REPOINT every reference to the old numeric id in the SAME change,
   or the lint cross-checks fire:
   - **floor baselines** — if the old id is in `ac-score-baseline.jsonl` /
     `protection-floor.json` (raise-only), migrate that entry too, else Gate B
     reds on the net-deleted id. (Grep both first; most legacy ids are tracked.)
   - **other EPIC docs** — repoint cross-references (`lint_doc_consistency`
     check4 `epic_to_registry`; e.g. EPIC-008's e2e map pointed at `AC26.x`).
   - **test references** — update the id in the test docstrings/`@ac_proof`
     (check5 `registry_to_tests` scans test-file text for the dotted id).

7. **Delete the EPIC table ROW, but keep the EPIC REFERENCING the new ids.**
   Remove the `| ACx.y.z | … |` definition row (else `check_epic_package_dual`
   fails — no AC defined in two places), and replace the section with a
   disclaimer that **lists every homed `AC-<pkg>.x.y` id** — a registry AC must
   still be *referenced* by an EPIC doc (`lint_doc_consistency` check3
   `registry_to_epic`); a prose mention satisfies it, a table row would re-trip
   `check_epic_package_dual`. (See EPIC-025/EPIC-026 for the pattern.)

8. **Register & classify.** Register any new concept in
   [`MANIFEST.yaml`](data/MANIFEST.yaml) (owner path + `family`+`kind`) —
   `docs/ssot/` is retired (#1823); the owner is always a package file
   (`common/<pkg>/readme.md`, `contract.py`, or a `data/` gate-data file);
   classify tooling tests in
   [`traceability-exceptions.md`](../../docs/project/traceability-exceptions.md).

9. **Run the gates locally before pushing:** `check_package_contract`,
   `check_package_directory_coverage`, `generate_ac_registry --check`,
   `check_ac_proof_kind`, `check_tier_ast_literal`, `check_epic_package_dual`,
   `check_draft_packages`, `check_tier_imports`, `check_authority_reconcile`, and
   `lint_doc_consistency`. The untagged-debt ratchet shrinks automatically as the
   moved ACs leave the EPIC source.

## What a tier is

This package owns the **authority-tier** vocabulary: the attribute that records
**how a module is built along one axis — who produces its result and how tightly
code constrains the LLM**. The tier is a **module-design property**, declared once
on a package's [`PackageContract`](../meta/package_contract.py); every AC the
package owns *inherits* it.

| tier | who produces the result |
|------|-------------------------|
| `CODE-ONLY` | code, no LLM |
| `CODE-LED` | code; the LLM only assists within strict code constraints |
| `LLM-LED` | the LLM emits; code validates/guards, never produces |
| `LLM-ONLY` | the LLM emits, no validation |

(`HU` = "undecided" — a draft package with `tier=None`, not a permanent tier.)

> **A tier is NOT a per-record confidence.** "How confident are we in *this one*
> extracted row?" is a runtime number on a result, handled by reconciliation /
> review flows. "How is this *module* built?" is its tier. They are different
> axes — do not conflate them.

The payoff is direct: **a module's tier dictates what KIND of proof is valid for
its ACs.** Tying the testing strategy to authority stops us from demanding a
bit-exact golden assertion for an LLM-owned mapping (impossible) or accepting a
smoke test for a money calculation (unsafe).

## The axis and the four permanent tiers

There is **one axis**: how much of the result the LLM produces, and how tightly
code boxes it in. Two binary cuts — *does code or the LLM produce the used
result* (hard vs soft) × *how strong is the code discipline* — give four
permanent tiers:

| Code | Name | Produces the result | Reproducible? | Typical modules |
|------|------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **CODE-ONLY** | pure-code | **Code**, no LLM | Bit-level, fully reproducible | money/accounting, dedup, validation, persistence, reporting-calc, **recording a human decision/label** |
| **CODE-LED** | code-primary | **Code**; the LLM only assists within strict code constraints on the I/O and decisions | Reproducible once the config/knobs are pinned | model/strategy selection feeding a deterministic parser; LLM-tuned thresholds with deterministic scoring |
| **LLM-LED** | LLM-primary | **The LLM**; code validates its format/invariants and may reject, never produces | Not reproducible but DETECTABLE | extraction, OCR, classification, brokerage CSV→canonical mapping |
| **LLM-ONLY** | pure-LLM | **The LLM**, with no validation | Not required | advisor narrative, chat answer/suggestion text |

The **hard/soft** cut (who produces the used artifact) falls between CODE-LED and LLM-LED —
the same "who emits" test as before: code computes it and the LLM only turned
knobs → **CODE-LED**; the LLM emits it and code only validates/constrains → **LLM-LED**.

### HU is not a permanent tier — it is "undecided"

The legacy vocabulary had a fifth code, **HU** (human-adjudicated). In the module-design
model it is **not a peer tier**: it means *the module's tier has not been decided
yet*. It is represented by a `draft` package with `tier=None` and **MUST resolve
to one of CODE-ONLY/CODE-LED/LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY before the package goes `active`** (see the rule below).

There is deliberately **no permanent "human" tier**, because:

- **Genuine human review is narrow and is an *input*.** The only place a person
  truly adjudicates is where reconciliation does not match and a human decides or
  labels. The matching engine is CODE-ONLY/CODE-LED (deterministic scoring); the human's
  decision is an *input* to a CODE-ONLY module that records it — exactly like an
  uploaded file or an FX rate is an input. The proof is a deterministic
  assertion that the **evidence chain** is surfaced and the chosen label is
  applied correctly — not an assertion of the human's outcome.
- So "a human decides" never describes *how a module is built*; it describes a
  runtime input the module consumes.

## One vocabulary, two views

The same four-tier scale is used by both views, which is why they cannot drift:

- **declared** — `PackageContract.tier` (a package's authorial intent);
- **detected** — the band `authority_classifier` measures from the shapes of the
  tests that prove a package's ACs (`BANDS` *is* `PACKAGE_TIERS`).

## Tier is a module property — one package, one tier

Because the tier describes construction, it lives on the **package**, not on each
AC:

- `PackageContract.tier` is the single declaration; ACs inherit it.
- **One package = one tier.** A module that genuinely both *emits via the LLM*
  and *computes deterministically* is two bounded contexts — split it into two
  packages (LLM-LED's definition already includes the code-side validation gate, so a
  well-formed LLM-LED package does not need a separate CODE-ONLY tier for its guard).

### The shipped-package rule (replaces the per-AC ratchet for packages)

> **`status="active"` (or `"deprecated"`) ⟹ `tier ∈ {CODE-ONLY, CODE-LED, LLM-LED, LLM-ONLY}`.**
> Only a `draft` package may leave `tier=None` (the "undecided" / legacy `HU`
> state). `PackageContract` enforces this at construction, so a *shipped untyped
> package is unrepresentable*.

### Structural assertions go in `invariants`, not `roadmap`

A package's **structural / governance guarantees** — interface == `__all__`,
"converges by **layer**" (base/extension/data), layer-purity (`base` never imports
`extension`/`data`), "passes its own `check_package_contract`" — are NOT domain ACs. They are
deterministic properties of *how the package is assembled*, so they belong in
`PackageContract.invariants` (which carry no tier and are not constrained by the
tier→proof matrix), and the `roadmap` holds only the package's **domain** ACs,
which inherit the package tier.

This matters for **non-CODE-ONLY packages**: a structural assertion is inherently an
`exact`/deterministic test. If it sat in the `roadmap` of an **LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY** package it
would inherit that tier and the proof-matrix gate would reject it (LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY may not
be `exact`) — or force a dishonest mislabel. Putting it in `invariants` removes
the conflict. The matrix gate is therefore the enforcement: a structural `exact`
test wrongly placed in an LLM-LED roadmap fails CI, pushing it to `invariants` (no new
bespoke lint needed).

`common/counter` is the worked example: its `roadmap` is pure domain (key
validation, count, increment, query) while its structural guarantees
(`converges-by-layer`, `base-layer-pure`, `interface-equals-published-language`,
`passes-own-governance-gate`) are `invariants`. A CODE-ONLY package like `counter` would
not *fail* with structural ACs in its roadmap (CODE-ONLY permits `exact`), but it follows
the convention so it is a correct template to copy for LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY packages.

## tier -> valid proof type

This matrix is the operative contract: which proof shape is *valid* evidence for
an AC under a package at each tier. Its single machine source is
`TIER_VALID_PROOF_KINDS` in `common/meta/base/authority_matrix.py` (the same
matrix `PackageContract` and `check_ac_proof_kind` both enforce).

| Tier | Valid proof | NOT valid |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **CODE-ONLY** | Deterministic exact-assertion / property test; bit-level reproducible | — |
| **CODE-LED** | Test asserts the **code's final decision** is correct; the LLM suggestion may vary and is **not** asserted | Asserting the LLM suggestion text |
| **LLM-LED** | Invariant/property test + graded eval + provenance | Exact "golden" assertions on the LLM output |
| **LLM-ONLY** | Quality/smoke eval + guardrail assertions (must not touch numbers) | Reproducibility / exact-match requirements |
| **HU** *(legacy/undecided)* | Test asserts the **evidence chain** is present (evidence + options surfaced) | Asserting the human's outcome |

The rule with teeth: **an LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY behavior MUST NOT be proven by an exact golden
assertion** — LLM-emitted output has no golden oracle. The `HU` row applies only
to the handful of pre-package ACs still carrying the legacy marker; new packages
do not use it.

## Cross-tier MUST rules

Hard rules a module's tier must respect — the safety boundary between the
deterministic core and the LLM surface:

1. **No LLM-sourced financial truth without a deterministic oracle.** LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY
   output MUST cross a CODE-ONLY oracle (validation/guard) before it is persisted as
   financial truth. An LLM never writes a ledger number unchecked.
2. **CODE-ONLY stays pure.** A CODE-ONLY module MUST NOT depend on an LLM client; its outcome
   is produced and proven by deterministic code alone.
3. **LLM-ONLY owns no money.** A LLM-ONLY module MUST NOT source a number or persist
   financial facts; its deliverable is narrative/UX text with low blast radius.
4. **One package = one tier.** A package whose behaviors span tiers is too coarse
   and MUST be split (e.g. an LLM extractor that also validates-then-persists is
   an LLM-LED package whose guard is its code-side validation, not a CODE-ONLY package).

### Enforcing rule 2 structurally — the tier-import guard (phase 3)

Rule 2 ("CODE-ONLY stays pure") has a *structural* half that is checkable statically:
a deterministic financial-truth (CODE-ONLY) module MUST NOT **import** the LLM layer.
`tools/check_tier_imports.py` (impl `common/meta/extension/check_tier_imports.py`) makes
this a deterministic gate, AST-based and direct-import-only, complementing the
per-AC `{proof:KIND}` gate. On `main` today no protected module imports the LLM
layer, so the gate starts GREEN — it is a guard against regression.

The contract (the checker is the machine-checkable mirror of this list):

- **Protected CODE-ONLY / financial-truth module set:** everything under
  `apps/backend/src/audit/money/**` and `apps/backend/src/ledger/**`
  (including the journal model, `apps/backend/src/ledger/orm/journal.py`),
  and the deterministic services
  `deduplication.py`, `accounting.py`, `account_service.py`,
  `investment_accounting.py`, `statement_posting.py`, the `reporting/**`
  package, `reporting_calc.py`, `reporting_snapshot.py`, `validation.py`,
  `statement_validation.py`, `fx.py` / `fx_revaluation.py` / `fx_transfer.py` /
  `fx_transfer_discovery.py`, `portfolio.py`, `performance.py`,
  `performance_report.py`, and `allocation.py`.
- **Forbidden import targets:** the project's LLM layer (`src.llm` /
  `apps.backend.src.llm`) and any raw LLM SDK / provider client — `litellm`,
  `openrouter`, `anthropic`, `openai` — including any submodule of those
  (prefix match on dotted-path boundaries, so `src.llmx` does not match).

Detection is **direct imports only** for v1 (both `import X` and
`from X import …`, including the parent-package spelling `from src import llm`
which pulls `src.llm` into scope); transitive import-graph following is a
documented follow-up.
A protected glob that resolves to no file also fails the gate, so the curated set
cannot silently shrink as the tree evolves.

## How a tier is declared

**Primary (package model):** on the `PackageContract`, once per package:

```python
CONTRACT = PackageContract(
    name="counter",
    status="active",
    tier="CODE-ONLY",        # the whole package's authority tier; every AC inherits it
    ...
)
```

`common/meta/extension/generate_ac_registry.py` reads this package tier statically (AST) and
stamps it onto every AC in the package's `roadmap`, so the registry value carries
the inherited tier.

**Legacy (EPIC-table source, being phased out):** a pre-package AC declares its
tier inline at the definition site with a `{tier:XX}` marker, where `XX` is one of
`CODE-ONLY | CODE-LED | HU | LLM-LED | LLM-ONLY`:

```text
| AC-extraction.1.1 | Parse DBS PDF {tier:LLM-LED} | `test_...` | `extraction/test_pdf_parsing.py` | P0 |
| AC-extraction.2.1 | Balance Validation (Pass) {tier:CODE-ONLY} | `test_balance_valid` | ... | P0 |
```

`tools/generate_ac_registry.py` strips the marker and lifts the tier into the AC's
registry value. As modules become packages, their ACs move into the package
`roadmap` and the marker (including any legacy `HU`) goes away.

## How a proof kind is declared (and enforced)

Each AC declares the KIND of proof its tests provide with a `proof_kind` (on the
`ACRecord`, or a `{proof:KIND}` marker in the legacy EPIC source). `KIND` is one
of `property | invariant | eval | exact | evidence | smoke`. When an AC declares
**no** proof kind, it defaults to its (package) tier's canonical valid kind, so
the value is always a kind the matrix accepts:

| Tier | Default proof kind |
|------|--------------------|
| CODE-ONLY | `exact` |
| CODE-LED | `exact` |
| LLM-LED | `property` |
| LLM-ONLY | `smoke` |
| HU *(legacy)* | `evidence` |

`PackageContract` validates each roadmap AC's `proof_kind` against the package
tier at construction (a violating contract fails to import);
`tools/check_ac_proof_kind.py` enforces the same matrix for the legacy EPIC
source. The rule with teeth is **an LLM-LED/LLM-ONLY AC's proof_kind MUST NOT be `exact`**.
Statically verifying the referenced test's runtime *shape* (so a golden assertion
mislabeled `property` is rejected) is a documented follow-up.

`proof_kind` is a different axis from the critical-proof matrix's `trust_mode`
(`deterministic_pr` / `llm_ocr_post_merge` / `hybrid`): `trust_mode` says which
CI stage may be trusted to run a proof, while `proof_kind` says what SHAPE of
proof is valid for the module's authority tier. They are orthogonal.

## Adoption (non-breaking)

- **Package model:** the shipped-package rule above is enforced at construction —
  no ratchet needed, because an active package physically cannot omit its tier.
- **Legacy EPIC source:** ~1830 ACs predate this attribute, adopted via a
  **shrink-only debt ratchet** in [`ac-tier-baseline.json`](../../common/meta/data/ac-tier-baseline.json).
  `tools/check_ac_tier_baseline.py` is id-based: it fails only when a genuinely
  new AC (id absent from the baseline) lacks a tier; the baseline may only shrink.
  Each module that becomes a package moves its ACs into the package `roadmap`,
  which removes them from the untagged debt.

## CODE/LLM bit (counted view)

This is the **measured** mirror of the declared `PackageContract.tier`: the same
**hard/soft cut** of the four permanent tiers, but **detected per-AC from its test
shape** rather than declared on the package.

- `CODE` — the hard side (`CODE-ONLY`, `CODE-LED`): a structured-input deterministic test, no
  LLM in the loop.
- `LLM` — the soft side (`LLM-LED`, `LLM-ONLY`): the AC's test exercises the record/replay
  (cassette) harness.
- An undecided/`draft` package (legacy `HU`, `tier=None`) is **unclassified**, not
  a band — it has not resolved its tier yet.

Each package (currently an EPIC) gets an `LLM-share = #LLM / (#CODE + #LLM)` placed
into four bands:

| Band | LLM-share (`s`) | Meaning |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| `CODE-ONLY` | `s = 0` | enforceable: no LLM permitted (money math, ledger) |
| `CODE-LED` | `0 < s < 50` | measured; ratchet caps drift |
| `LLM-LED` | `50 ≤ s < 100` | measured; ratchet caps drift |
| `LLM-ONLY` | `s = 100` | enforceable: no hardcode permitted (narrative) |

Because the bit is detected, the band is **computed, not argued** — so it serves
as a **cross-check on the declared `PackageContract.tier`**: a package declared on
the hard side (`CODE-ONLY`/`CODE-LED`) but measuring `LLM` ACs is drift. The base
library is `common/meta/extension/authority_classifier.py`; `tools/authority_counter.py`
prints the live view on demand (no committed snapshot). This cross-check is
**enforced** by `tools/check_authority_reconcile.py`, which fails CI at the
enforceable ends (declared `CODE-ONLY` ⟹ no `LLM` test; `LLM-ONLY` ⟹ no
deterministic test). The cross-tier MUST rules still bind (an `LLM` value entering
financial truth crosses a CODE-ONLY oracle; an `LLM` AC must have a cassette).

## Structure (layers)

The **target** model — like every migrated package — is to converge by **layer**
(base / extension / data) rather than by role. `authority` is **not there yet**:
its `contract.py` still declares legacy `roles=["matrix", "classifier", "gates"]`
and the files are physically flat under `common/meta` (base for the matrix, extension for the gates). The base/extension
split below is therefore the **conceptual/intended** layering each file maps onto;
the role-to-layer migration is still pending.

- **base** — the value language: `authority_matrix.py` (tier Literals, the
  tier→proof matrix, the canonical tuples; stdlib-only, no pydantic) and
  `authority_classifier.py` (the detected CODE/LLM band). Self-contained pure
  definitions + logic, no I/O.
- **extension** — the gates (run via `tools/<name>.py`): `check_ac_proof_kind`
  (tier→proof matrix), `check_tier_ast_literal`, `check_tier_imports`,
  `check_ac_tier_baseline`, `check_authority_reconcile` (declared vs detected at
  the enforceable ends). The impure edges that read the repo and fail CI.

## Published language

`__init__.__all__` (must equal `contract.interface`): the tier vocabulary +
matrix + the classifier's `band` / `classify_repo` / `BANDS`.

## Follow-ups (out of scope here)

- Migrating the remaining EPIC-table ACs into package `roadmap`s (the ratchet
  shrinks as packages adopt them); retiring the `{tier:XX}` marker and the `HU`
  code once no EPIC AC carries them.
- A derived **module-level tier view** (already the natural unit now that tier is
  per-package).
- Upgrading the proof-kind gate from asserting the *declared* `proof_kind` to
  statically inspecting the referenced test's shape (e.g. rejecting an
  exact-golden assertion mislabeled `property` on an LLM-LED AC).
